1. Project Title / Headline
British Airways Review Dashboard
An interactive, analytical dashboard providing an in-depth look at British Airways customer reviews and ratings across service categories, flight classes, aircraft types, and global routes.

2. Short Description / Purpose
This dashboard is designed to help users explore and analyze customer sentiment and service ratings for British Airways from March 2016 to October 2023. It enables business managers, analysts, and travelers to evaluate performance trends, identify service strengths and weaknesses, and understand how experiences vary by route, aircraft, and customer type.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

ðŸŸ© Tableau Desktop â€“ Main visualization and dashboard platform.
ðŸ”Ž Data Preparation Tools (e.g., Tableau Prep, Power Query) â€“ For cleaning and shaping data prior to analysis.
ðŸ§® Calculated Fields / Level-of-Detail Expressions â€“ For measures such as averages and dynamic filters.
ðŸ•Œ Custom Mapping â€“ Used to visualize country-level reviews and service ratings.

Data Structure:
The dataset captures:
Ratings (overall, cabin staff, ground service, seat comfort, value, food, entertainment).
Review counts by aircraft type, service class, and country of origin.
Filters for date range, traveler types (business, couple leisure, family leisure), seat type, and region.

5. Features / Highlights
- Business Problem
British Airways, like many airlines, receives thousands of customer reviews each year. Managers, analysts, and consumers struggle to gian actionable insights from raw review platforms, especially for comparing service across aircraft, routes, or customer segments.

- Goal of the Dashboard
To create a single, dynamic tool that:
1.Visualizes service ratings and sentiment trends by time, country, aircraft, and customer type.
2.Enables quick comparison of service aspects (staff, food, comfort, etc.).
3.Supports decisions for improving service quality, marketing efforts, and customer experience design.
